    "In this challenge, the REST API contains information about football competitions and matches. The provided API allows querying competitions by name and year, and it also allows querying matches by competition and year. The task, for a given competition name and year, is to get the total number of goals scored by the team who won the competition.\n",
    "To access a competition, perform an HTTP GET request to\n",
    "https://jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/football_competitions?name=<name>&year=<year>\n",

    "For example GET request to\n",
    "https://jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/football_competitions?name=EnglishPremierLeague&year=2014\n",
    "returns data associated with the English Premier League in the year 2014.\n",
    "The response to such a request is a JSON object that contains the property data, which is an array of competitions. In this case, the array will contain only a single item. The item has the following 5 fields:\n",
    "-> name: a string denoting the name of the competition\n",
    "-> country: a string denoting the name of the country of the competition\n",
    "-> year: an integer denoting the year of the competition\n",
